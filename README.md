# php-5.6andOver-Click2Mail-ClientSDK
To run it:
1. Please download it using any of the several methods that github provides (I use the Github desktop but, if you are not familiar with git, you can simply download the zip),
2. Set your stage.click2mail.com username and password in rest_simpleMail.php
3. Run it with the command:
> php rest_simpleMail.php

All goes well, you should see the following output:
